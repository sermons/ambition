I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” <br>
But behold, this also was vanity.

I said of laughter, “It is mad,” <br>
and of pleasure, “What use is it?”

[Ecclesiastes 2:1-2 (ESV) (p.1/7)](# "ref")

******
[3](# "ref")
I searched with my heart <br>
how to cheer my body with wine<br>
-- my heart still guiding me with wisdom --

and how to lay hold on folly, <br>
till I might see what was good for the children of man <br>
to do under heaven during the few days of their life.

[Ecclesiastes 2:3 (ESV) (p.2/7)](# "ref")

******
[4](# "ref")
I made great works. <br>
I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.

[5](# "ref")
I made myself gardens and parks, <br>
and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.

[6](# "ref")
I made myself pools from which to water <br>
the forest of growing trees.

[Ecclesiastes 2:4-6 (ESV) (p.3/7)](# "ref")

******
[7](# "ref")
I bought male and female slaves, <br>
and had slaves who were born in my house.

I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, <br>
more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.

[Ecclesiastes 2:7 (ESV) (p.4/7)](# "ref")

******
[8](# "ref")
I also gathered for myself silver and gold <br>
and the treasure of kings and provinces.

I got singers, both men and women, <br>
and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man.

[9](# "ref")
So I became great and surpassed all <br>
who were before me in Jerusalem.

Also my wisdom remained with me.

[Ecclesiastes 2:8-9 (ESV) (p.5/7)](# "ref")

******
[10](# "ref")
And whatever my eyes desired <br>
I did not keep from them. 

I kept my heart from no pleasure, <br>
for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, <br>
and this was my reward for all my toil.

[Ecclesiastes 2:10 (ESV) (p.6/7)](# "ref")

******
[11](# "ref")
Then I considered all that my hands had done <br>
and the toil I had expended in doing it,

and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, <br>
and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
